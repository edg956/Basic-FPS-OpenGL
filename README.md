# Computer graphics programming project
This is a program implemented for the course Computer Graphics at Technische Hochschule Ulm

It consists of a 3D model created using Blender 2.8, imported to a C++ program and rendered using OpenGL 4+. It's a simulation of a
3D first person shooter with some basic shading and a minimap included.

# Showcases
The practical part of the course consisted in creating 3 showcases:

* 2D showcase containing some 2D transformations (minimap)
* Shaders showcase (Light from the moon and flashlight
* 3D showcase containing 3D transformations to move the camera around the map.

## Building
### Requirements
* Microsoft Visual Studio (2019 used in this case) with C++ compiler
*CMake 3+

Using CMake, select this repo's folder as source and a folder for binaries, configure, generate and open the project.
